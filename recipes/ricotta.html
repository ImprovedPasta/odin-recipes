        The ricotta is an Italian cheese made by cooking the whey (liquid byproduct of the cheese production), by cooking it at an high temperature (80-90°C), hence the name “ricotta”, which means “cooked again”. Even though it’s typically made from the whey, you can make it directly from the milk as well.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cheesecloth</li>
        <li>1 cheese recipient</li>
        <li>2l of whey</li>
        <li>500ml of milk (or if not using whey, 2l of milk)</li>
        <li>10g of table salt</li>
        <li>6g of citric acid (contained in 130ml of lemon juice)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        Pour the milk (and/or whey) and the salt into a pot, stir it well, and heat it up to 80°C. Once the temperature has been reached, add the citric acid (or lemon juice) and stir well. You should already see the citric acid react with the milk/whey. Heat it up to 90°C Pour the ricotta in the cheesecloth and let the whey drip. Move the ricotta into the cheese recipient. Store in the fridge.
